# Proteins.R
# My initial attempts to analyse protein sequences in R
# 25-Sept-2017

# At this point I can fetch protein IDs, sequences, domains and other information using biomaRt and even align sequences using msa.
# I am hoping to make 2D plots of protein properties by amino acid, as well as metaplot or heatmaps based on multiple protein sequences.
